We'll cover string functions, logical functions, date functions, reshaping data, merging data using lookup functions and perhaps a few other nifty tricks if time allows. We’ll do some “drills” introducing you to these concepts, then put your new skills to work in a sort of “scrimmage,” fixing up some real-life data. You’ll also walk out with practice data and a 30-page tipsheet that covers, in detail, everything from the class, plus more that we won’t have time for.\n\nPreregistration is required and seating is limited.

A curious mind and good attitude are all that’s required.\n\nPreregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided.",

    "description": "In an interconnected world, data is more accessible than ever—but finding and using global data comes with unique challenges. In this panel, reporters will explore strategies for locating reliable international datasets and navigating the obstacles that come with using them. From language barriers to currency conversions, inconsistent formats, and varying levels of data transparency, journalists must adapt to diverse contexts to uncover the story within the data. Panelists will share practical solutions for addressing these challenges, including best practices for working with multilingual datasets, standardizing metrics across borders, and verifying sources in regions with limited transparency. Additionally, the session will tackle the complex issue of obtaining documents and records in countries where public records laws are weak, inefficient, or nonexistent. Panelists will highlight creative approaches to accessing critical information, from building local partnerships to leveraging non-traditional sources.\nKey questions for discussion during the panel:\n- What are the most effective methods for identifying and accessing reliable global data sources?\n- What unique challenges do international datasets present—such as language barriers, currency discrepancies, or incompatible formats—and what strategies can help overcome them?\n- How can journalists access critical documents in countries where public records laws are weak, inefficient, or nonexistent?",

With the demise of Whois, investigative reporters are looking for new tools to uncover these footprints. Learn how to use DNSDB Scout, a tool to query DNSDB, a historical passive DNS database, to discover previously unknown online connections and gain new information to advance your  ongoing and breaking news investigations. \n\nBasic knowledge of the Domain Name System (DNS) is helpful, but not required.

This bill tracker, through BillTrack50, allows journalists to search for bills by topic and analyze the data going back 14 years. The tool integrates machine learning, which allows searches with greater precision, reducing misses resulting from simple keyword searches. Come to this session to learn how to use it. See the application of the tool by the University of Florida Brechner Freedom of Information Project to track secrecy legislation, and hear from the data experts at Stanford University’s Big Local News on possible applications of this data, along with other civic information search tools they provide for journalists.",

Unlike competing packages, it gives access to almost everything the Census Bureau produces, including American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey, the Supplemental Poverty Measure and so on. It even has methods for downloading geographic resources like Tiger Shapefiles. My favorite part is that it has methods for quickly exploring which datasets and tables are available, so that you know what exists before you configure a whole script to try and download it. The greatest feature, however, is that it can download your census data and output a choropleth of any geography in a single function call. It's made my work with the Census faster, more reliable and more enjoyable.",

    "description": "Working on deadline, news graphics need to be made quickly. They also often require customization to meet the needs of the day's story accurately and cleanly. These two requirements are often at odds with one another. Graphics libraries that let you make charts quickly are often not customizable. The most customizable graphics framework, D3, often requires a great deal of prep and code to even make a simple bar chart.\n\nIn this presentation, we'll look at Layer Cake, which is a graphics framework in Svelte built for these twin demands of a newsroom. Its approach is different from most frameworks or libraries you may have worked with and we'll look at how you can create reusable code to  produce engaging graphics in a fast-paced environment.\n\nThis session is good for people who have knowledge of JavaScript and D3 already and want to learn how to translate that to Svelte. Experience with Svelte is not required but will be helpful. We'll discuss the philosophy behind project code as much as possible. Attendees will need to bring their own laptop (no tablets) for the training.",

Usually it leads to a frustratingly common question: Who is behind this website?\n\nUsing a range of tools (free and otherwise), we walk you through how to investigate the provenance and ownership of websites: how can you identify the scope and scale of the network it belongs to — if any? Who’s behind the site, now and in the past? Who are the main actors promoting this website? Where else does this site crop up?\n\nWhile it is not always possible to fully unmask the owner of a site, using a thorough checklist of tools and techniques that we have used in real-world investigations, we can help you make sure to reveal as much as possible about a website, and potentially uncover important clues.",

Sure, doing simple mapping in it and ArcGIS is a blast, but executing complex, reproducible joins and measurements can be a real drag. Taking a more scripted approach is way less of a buzzkill, especially when you need to revisit your earlier work or share with others.\n\nWhether you choose R or Python, follow along from mapping basics to more complex techniques that will make your next geospatial analysis a walk in the park. Cut loose, write some replicable code and have fun with shapes!\n\nPreregistration is required and seating is limited.

We’ll demonstrate how to write these types of functions and give examples of the situations in which they’re particularly useful. At a minimum, attendees would leave the session knowing how to get much closer to publication-ready graphics without leaving R in far fewer lines of code.

In this session, participants can learn how to get the most out of the database, including making industry comparisons, connecting parent companies through subsidiaries and other tips for digging into companies. Because many companies also receive significant government assistance via economic development subsidies, we'll also tour Subsidy Tracker, a database which allows users the ability to search which companies have received taxpayer subsidies. We'll also demonstrate our newest database, Violation Tracker Global, which tracks the behavior of the biggest companies across 45 countries. Plus, learn about SEC filings, corporate structures, and the key relationships that keep a company going. Cover how companies actually behave - not how they say they do.",

They come with an extra layer of challenges because their very job (and likely their personality) makes them hyper-alert to authority figures. This course is designed to give you some tools and tactics to lead individuals and entire teams of investigators more effectively. Learn from three investigative managers from different media at different stages of their leadership careers. How did they launch into their roles, and what experience have they gained along the way? This course is for current investigative managers and anyone aspiring to step into such a position in the future.\n\nNEW AT NICAR25: We’ll tailor portions of this course for people who lead data journalists. We’re also squeezing it into two hours of learning, then an hour-long management networking/meetup event. Oh… and it’s free to attend (typically, an additional fee is required)!\n\nTopics will include: managing compassionately, hiring challenges, transitioning to management, forging partnerships, building relationships, handling resource cuts, organization/structure, tough decisions/conversations, in-house training/growth, delivering feedback, creating inclusive opportunities, and juggling responsibilities/projects/work.",
