We'll cover string functions, logical functions, date functions, reshaping data, merging data using lookup functions and perhaps a few other nifty tricks if time allows. We’ll do some “drills” introducing you to these concepts, then put your new skills to work in a sort of “scrimmage,” fixing up some real-life data. You’ll also walk out with practice data and a 30-page tipsheet that covers, in detail, everything from the class, plus more that we won’t have time for.\n\nPreregistration is required and seating is limited.

    "description": "In an interconnected world, data is more accessible than ever—but finding and using global data comes with unique challenges. In this panel, reporters will explore strategies for locating reliable international datasets and navigating the obstacles that come with using them. From language barriers to currency conversions, inconsistent formats, and varying levels of data transparency, journalists must adapt to diverse contexts to uncover the story within the data. Panelists will share practical solutions for addressing these challenges, including best practices for working with multilingual datasets, standardizing metrics across borders, and verifying sources in regions with limited transparency. Additionally, the session will tackle the complex issue of obtaining documents and records in countries where public records laws are weak, inefficient, or nonexistent. Panelists will highlight creative approaches to accessing critical information, from building local partnerships to leveraging non-traditional sources.\nKey questions for discussion during the panel:\n- What are the most effective methods for identifying and accessing reliable global data sources?\n- What unique challenges do international datasets present—such as language barriers, currency discrepancies, or incompatible formats—and what strategies can help overcome them?\n- How can journalists access critical documents in countries where public records laws are weak, inefficient, or nonexistent?",

Instead of keyword search – which misses misspellings, paraphrase and use of terms that the user hasn't thought of  – semantic search finds results whose meaning is similar to that of the query.\n\nIt's a guaranteed-safe way to use AI in a newsroom context, because the only downside of a \"false positive\" match is wasting the reporter's time in reading the irrelevant search results.\n\nLet's talk about the use-cases where we've used it, the fiddly choices we have to make when using semantic search, and the bright new future that awaits us.",

While those deals are often reported upon, what's less analyzed are the impacts of those tax breaks and other subsidies on budgets, and what, if anything, communities get in return. Using Subsidy Tracker and Tax Break Tracker help answer those questions. Learn how to use the databases and how reporters have used them in their reporting to show the impact of corporate giveaways. Subsidy Tracker lets users explore what companies are receiving incentives and where, and Tax Break Tracker shows users how much revenue governments give up in the name of economic development. This session would be especially useful for local and state government reporters, as well as those covering education (the public service that loses the most funding when incentives are given due to its dependence on property taxes).",

We'll also touch on other practical applications like collecting data from APIs and monitoring websites for real-time updates. Use ChatGPT to write your scripts, and learn some JavaScript along the way. Elevate your journalism by automating routine tasks, so you can focus on crafting compelling stories.\nThis session is good for people who have a firm grasp of spreadsheets and are ready to take those skills to the next level. Some experience programming in any language will be helpful, but is not required. Attendees will need to bring their own laptop (no tablets) and a Google account for the training.",

These two requirements are often at odds with one another. Graphics libraries that let you make charts quickly are often not customizable. The most customizable graphics framework, D3, often requires a great deal of prep and code to even make a simple bar chart.\n\nIn this presentation, we'll look at Layer Cake, which is a graphics framework in Svelte built for these twin demands of a newsroom. Its approach is different from most frameworks or libraries you may have worked with and we'll look at how you can create reusable code to  produce engaging graphics in a fast-paced environment.\n\nThis session is good for people who have knowledge of JavaScript and D3 already and want to learn how to translate that to Svelte. Experience with Svelte is not required but will be helpful. We'll discuss the philosophy behind project code as much as possible.

Usually it leads to a frustratingly common question: Who is behind this website?\n\nUsing a range of tools (free and otherwise), we walk you through how to investigate the provenance and ownership of websites: how can you identify the scope and scale of the network it belongs to — if any? Who’s behind the site, now and in the past? Who are the main actors promoting this website? Where else does this site crop up?\n\nWhile it is not always possible to fully unmask the owner of a site, using a thorough checklist of tools and techniques that we have used in real-world investigations, we can help you make sure to reveal as much as possible about a website, and potentially uncover important clues.",

In this session, participants can learn how to get the most out of the database, including making industry comparisons, connecting parent companies through subsidiaries and other tips for digging into companies. Because many companies also receive significant government assistance via economic development subsidies, we'll also tour Subsidy Tracker, a database which allows users the ability to search which companies have received taxpayer subsidies. We'll also demonstrate our newest database, Violation Tracker Global, which tracks the behavior of the biggest companies across 45 countries. Plus, learn about SEC filings, corporate structures, and the key relationships that keep a company going. Cover how companies actually behave - not how they say they do.",

Learn from three investigative managers from different media at different stages of their leadership careers. How did they launch into their roles, and what experience have they gained along the way? This course is for current investigative managers and anyone aspiring to step into such a position in the future.\n\nNEW AT NICAR25: We’ll tailor portions of this course for people who lead data journalists. We’re also squeezing it into two hours of learning, then an hour-long management networking/meetup event. Oh… and it’s free to attend (typically, an additional fee is required)!\n\nTopics will include: managing compassionately, hiring challenges, transitioning to management, forging partnerships, building relationships, handling resource cuts, organization/structure, tough decisions/conversations, in-house training/growth, delivering feedback, creating inclusive opportunities, and juggling responsibilities/projects/work.",

For journalists, working with high-quality survey data can inspire story ideas and add deeper context to reporting, while mistakenly using a shoddy poll can distort the facts and create confusion. We’ll give attendees the tools to tell the difference.\nThis session is good for anyone who is fairly new to working with public opinion polls and would like to level up their understanding. It will cover what polls can tell us – and what they can't; and how to assess survey quality using metrics like questionnaire design, sample weighting and survey mode. We’ll also give tips on how to write about survey results in a fair and balanced way and pitfalls to avoid.",
